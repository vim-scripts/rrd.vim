The RRD.vim package is a vim module that acts as a frontend to manipulating the data from a round-robin database created by Tobi Oetiker's excellent  RRDTool program. It uses rrdtool to export the data into XML which it syntax highlights, and to re-import it again once you have made your changes. For a full description see the README_rrdplugin.txt file.
